# rwdslider
Since magento has launched RWD responsive theme they have provided cycle2 slider inbuilt with it. If you install the sample data you can see it on home page. But the issue is there is no backen for easily adding images. We have to upload images through cms pages WYSIWYG editor.  Whenever i used this slider i have got good feedback as it is responsive too but clients needed easier way to manage images for their slider. This compelled me to develop this extension . This extension has many backend settings and enabling you to manage images in groups so as to use multiple sliders and many effects too. An extra js has been added to enable vertical scrolling too which is addon of cycle2.
